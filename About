Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. 
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 
           a. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
           b. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
           c. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk
